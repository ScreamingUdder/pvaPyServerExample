# pvaPyServerExample
A Python PVA server for testing purposes. 

It is useable with the EPICS Forwarder but currently does not publish a time-stamp.

## Setting up
Requires EPICS V4 installed as it uses the pvaPy library; however, as of 22th May 2017 it must use the most recent version of pvaPy pulled from Github.

Once built, copy the pvaccess.so to your Python dist-packages directory (.
